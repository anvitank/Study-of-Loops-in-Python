**Title**

**Study of For Loop and While Loop in Python**

**Aim**

To study and implement the use of for loop and while loop in Python programming.

**Objectives**

- To understand the concept of iterative execution
- To perform loop creation and basic iteration
- To apply loop control using break and continue
- To understand the difference between entry-controlled and collection-based loops

**Theory**

Looping is a control structure that allows a set of statements to be executed repeatedly based on a condition or over a sequence. Python provides two main types of loops: the for loop and the while loop.

**1. For Loop**

A for loop in Python is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). Unlike loops in other programming languages, it acts more like an iterator method. It executes a set of statements once for each item in the collection or sequence.

**2. While Loop**

A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.  The loop will continue to run as long as the condition remains true. It is primarily used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

**Difference Between For Loop and While Loop**

- For loop is used when the number of iterations is known.
- While loop is used when the number of iterations depends on a condition.
- For loop automatically handles iteration over a sequence.
- While loop requires manual updating of the loop variable.

**Characteristics of Loops**

- Iterative: Executes code blocks repeatedly to process data structures like sets or dictionaries.
- Control Flow: Manages the sequence of execution based on specific conditions or keys.
- Efficiency: Reduces code redundancy by automating tasks such as removing duplicates.
- Automation: Commonly used for data processing and mathematical computations.

**Break Statement**

The break statement is used to alter the flow of a loop by terminating the loop prematurely. When the break keyword is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately abandoned, and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.  It is often used in conjunction with an if statement to exit based on a specific condition.

**Continue Statement**

The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop block and return to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration. Unlike break, it does not terminate the loop entirely; it simply bypasses the remaining statements in the current cycle to maintain the unique flow of the loop.


- For Loop: Typically used for iterating over a sequence or collection of unique elements.
- While Loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
- Break Statement: Used to immediately terminate the loop and exit the current block.
- Continue Statement: Used to skip the current iteration and move to the next cycle of the loop.

**Applications of Loops**

- Data Processing: Iterating through student records or unique sets of data.
- Configuration: Accessing and applying settings from dictionary-based configuration files.
- Filtering: Membership testing and removing duplicate records from a collection.
- Automation: Performing repetitive mathematical operations and database record updates.

**Conclusion**

Loops provide an efficient way to handle repetitive data tasks and traverse structures like sets and dictionaries. By using break and continue, programmers gain precise control over how and when code blocks should execute or terminate, making them essential for real-world applications.
